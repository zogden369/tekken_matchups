    <h1>Armor King Matchup</h1>

    <h3>Armor King is grappler that excells at punishment. A lot of his moves give him plus frames but are balanced by being high.
    Take advantage of this weakness if you notice your opponent favors some moves.</h3>

    <ul class="info_list">
      <li>
        <h4>F21</h4>
        <p>This move is Armor King's main whiff punisher. The second hit is high so duck and punish if your opponent is abusing this move</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>CD1</h4>
        <p>This move gives Armor King a whole 6 on block. If blocked, don't try to press anything because
        he has a fast counter hit launcher just for that. Your best bet is to duck premptively and punish.</p>

      <li>
        <h4>CD2</h4>
        <p>This is Armor King's other, more execution heavy whiff punisher. This move is also high,
        but the safer option is to wait and punish with your 10 frame. </p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>DB3</h4>
        <p>This move is a High crushing, low, counter hit launcher. Very good for catching people
        who jab too much. If blocked you can launch for a full combo. On normal hit it doesn't do much,
        so if you're patient you can bait Armor King into killing himself</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>F4</h4>
        <p>This a mid move that gives plus frames. Don't try to press after blocking.
          It can be sidestepped to both sides however, so watch for patterns. </p>
