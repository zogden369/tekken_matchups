    <h1>Kazuya Matchup</h1>

    <h3>Kazuya's main goal is to knock you down and mix you up.
      However, he is also able to punish his opponents mistakes heavily.
    He has a few very strong tools that help with this. Alot of his kit
    can be evaded by sidestepping left though. Take advantage of this.</h3>

    <ul class="info_list">
      <li>
        <h4>CD4</h4>
        <p>The best way to punish a hellsweep is to block it low and use your highest damage launcher.
          Blocking low too much againts kazuya is asking to get launched by another one of his moves
        further down this page. So essentially don't be predictable with your defense.</p>
        <img src="../gifs/kazuya/hellsweep_punish.gif" class="gifs" alt="">
        <p>Since you most likely won't know its coming so a safer option is to side step left.
        In fact, you can simply side walk left and you'll completely avoid the hellsweep.
      Kazuya does have some dangerous homing moves so be mindful and don't abuse this
    (unless of course your opponents refuses to adapt). Be aware that some combos don't work
    if you're not directly facing your opponent, so make sure to have a combo for this case.</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>CD2</h4>
        <p>Arguablely the best move in the game, the ewgf(Electric Wind God Fist) is a +5 high launcher.
        If blocked, its still kazuya's turn. Meaning you should keep blocking unless you have a read.
        There are a few notable weaknesses however.</p>
        <img src="../gifs/kazuya/block_ewgf.gif" class="gifs" alt="">
        <p>Like most of kazuya's move you can simply sidestep left to avoid an ewgf. It cannot be sidewalked
        or sidesteped right.</p>
        <img src="../gifs/kazuya/sidestep_ewgf.gif" class="gifs" alt="">
        <p>You can also duck and launch. Be careful doing this because you can be launched if kazuya
        catches on to what you're doing.</p>
        <img src="../gifs/kazuya/duck_ewgf.gif" class="gifs" alt="">
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>FF3</h4>
        <p>This is kazuya's mid launcher. Its -3 so you can't punish it,
        but it is your turn so jab or something to stop kazuya's presure.</p>
        <img src="../gifs/kazuya/block_ff3.gif" class="gifs" alt="">
        <p>If you want to punish, your best bet is to sidestep and launch. This move has no tracking.</p>
        <img src="../gifs/kazuya/sidestep_ff3.gif" class="gifs" alt="">
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>DF12</h4>
        <p>This move can lead to a guarenteed ff4 if connected so make sure to always punish
        with your 13 frame while standing move. Don't let kazuya get away with this.</p>
        <img src="../gifs/kazuya/block_df12.gif" class="gifs" alt="">
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>112</h4>
        <p>The last hit of this string can be launch punished by most of the cast. However,
        its possible to hit confirm. Always be on the lookout to see if kazuya messes up the hitconfirm
        and punish him for it.</p>
