<h1>Bryan Matchup</h1>

<h3>Bryan is a keep away character with many tools to punish you for getting too close.
Bryan's main weakness is the long recovery on his moves. Your best bet is to bait him
into throwing out a move and whiff punish.</h3>

<ul class="info_list">
  <li>
    <h4>DF3</h4>
    <p>Bryan's infamous snake edge. A high crushing low launcher that is the bain of most new players and a
    non factor at higher levels of play. You can react to the start up animation and launch it on block.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>F41</h4>
    <p>One of Bryan's best whiff punishers. It's possible to sidestep, but it's safer to simply punish
    with your 13 frame, while standing move.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>FF2</h4>
    <p>This move is a high, forward moving, powercrush. It stuffs most approach options excluding lows.
    It's safe on block, so either sidestep or duck to punish.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>3+4</h4>
    <p>A mid counter hit launcher. Another powerful part of his keepout game. It's -13
    but you cannot punish it because it pushes you away. Sidestep or whiff punish. </p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>UF4</h4>
    <p>This move is a mid, low crushing, safe on block, launcher. It's not possible to punish,
    but since it's minus you should take your turn. It also has literally no tracking so sidestepping is strong.
    You can even sidewalk.</p>
