<h1>Marduk Matchup</h1>

<h3>Marduk is a grappler with many ways to mix you up. You generally want to pressure him so that he
can't use any of his best tools.</h3>

<ul class="info_list">
  <li>
    <h4>Tackle</h4>
    <p>Marduk's infamous tackle. If successful, it forces a three way mix up.
      It can be completely avoid by any lowcrushing move or by pressing 1+2 the instant you're grabbed.
      once you are grabbed you have to guess between 1,2, or 1+2. The numbers correspond to which hand
    he attacks with. 1=left, 2=right, 1+2=both.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>B1+2</h4>
    <p>This is Marduk's armor crush move. It's only -10 so you have to be sharp if you want to punish it on block.
    You could try anticipating the move and ducking, but Marduk can punish you heavily if he sees what you're
  doing. </p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>DF1</h4>
    <p>Marduk's best launcher in terms of speed and utility. Perfect for whiff punishing and anying -15 or more.
    It's only -13, so it's easy for Marduk to get away with throwing this move out. Make him think twice about
  using it by punishing every time.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>QCF2</h4>
    <p>This move is one of Marduk's best low options. It's unseeable and gives big damage
    on counter hit. Either sidestep left or punish with your 12 frame while standing move.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>DB2</h4>
    <p>One of Marduks best options in neutral. It's A safe, mid, counter hit launcher. It's only punishable
    on whiff. So either sidestep or backdash to force a whiff.</p>
